You need to build a command-line expense tracker using JavaScript (Deno). This tool will allow users to:

- Add expenses (category, amount, date, description)
- List expenses (sorted by date, category, or amount)
- Search expenses (by category or description)
- Filter expenses (e.g., "Show all expenses above $100")
- Delete an expense
- Generate a summary report (total expenses, highest expense, breakdown by category)

🛠 Requirements:

- Store data in a JSON file (expenses.json).
- Handle reading/writing to the JSON file properly.
- Use error handling to prevent issues like missing files or invalid inputs.
- Allow users to interact via command-line arguments (Deno.args).
- Implement a sorting mechanism (date, amount, category).
- Use a flexible filtering function.
- Format output in a readable way.
  📝 Example Usage:

```
deno run expenses.js add Food 12.50 "2025-02-10" "Lunch with friends"
deno run expenses.js list amount
deno run expenses.js search Food
deno run expenses.js filter "amount>100"
deno run expenses.js remove "Lunch with friends"
deno run expenses.js summary
```
