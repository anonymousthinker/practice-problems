1. ~~updated directory structure~~
2. ~~how should i store the data? array of objects maybe?~~
3. ~~start with the first task, ie, add expenses~~
4. ~~then go on step by step~~
5. no testing as most of the stuff will be handled asynchronously
6. will maybe do a synchronous version of this code as well?

potential flaws that I didn't like in this and have to fix:

1. ~~I am repeating console.table() in multiple functions instead of reusing listExpenses() since most functions are parsing the json file seperately and asynchronously!~~
